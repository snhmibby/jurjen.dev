# Welcome
This site was created for practicing website building.
It focuses on a series of tutorials, in which I chronicle my journey of both
creating this website and learning website development at the same time.
If you are also just starting out, I hope it can be useful for you!

The wiki is a link to my recently started public private notes.
Also a link to my github account, where you can find some small toy programs,
libraries, configuration files and the source for this site.
