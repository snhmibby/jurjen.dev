# Welcome!

Let's learn Web Development, together!

This is the first website I ever built.
I thought it would be nice to structure this site around tutorial tracks,
documenting my journey into ~~madness~~ different aspects of Web Development.

## Yet another tutorial website?
Well, I need practice don't I?

But also, I have experience with actual programming since I was a little kid
and I hope this will help me in figuring out clean and simple solutions to
common beginner problems I will run into. And it would be worthwhile to
document my solutions, both for future me to ~~look up~~ be embarrassed about, as well as to help other beginners!

I also couldn't find a simple Hugo tutorial like one the Jekyll website.
I hope my Hugo tutorial can try to fill that gap eventually.
