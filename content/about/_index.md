# About me & this site

Recently I got fed up with my cranky boss at my old job so I quit.
Now he can shuffle shit himself (literally - I worked as a stable boy!).

I have given myself some free months to learn web development so I can
hopefully land a cool hipster job in the near future. This is my first proper
self made website other than some crappy HTML pages and bunch of folders or a
wiki. 

Despite not having much actual HTML/CSS/JS experience, I am comfortable with C,
Go, Haskell, SML, Python, shell programming, UNIX administration, low level
computer and networking basics, algorithms and data structures.

I also have practical experience in organic farming, large animal care (cows & horses),
building, maintenance and gardening. In short, I am the perfect candidate for the cool hipster job mentioned above!

Don't hesitate to [contact me](maito:info@jurjen.dev)!
