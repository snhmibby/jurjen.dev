# First post!

I thought it would be nice to chronicle my descent into madness here.
I decided to learn to make websites, this here being the first.

Whenever I learn something new or interesting about development or the technologies I use,
there will be a small post in my blog and/or on my [wiki](https://wiki.jurjen.dev).
Personally, I prefer a wiki, but then I wouldn't get to practice making this cool blagging site.
