# First post!
Whenever I learn something new or interesting about
development or the technologies I use, there will be a
small post in my blog and/or on my
[wiki](https://wiki.jurjen.dev).  Personally, I prefer a
wiki, but then I wouldn't get to practice making this
cool blagging site.

## Follow along on my journey!
In short, every major update on this site since the beginning will get a blog
post. If you want to follow along on my process on getting started from 0% with
Hugo and website building in general, just follow the blogs from beginning
to end.

I won't hold your hand on every piece of code I typed, every file I added...
But there will be enough posts and references that it should be a fun exercise
to follow me. I will end every blog post with a basic outline of what I did.
