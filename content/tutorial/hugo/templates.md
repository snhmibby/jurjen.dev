# Improving the default templates
The idea for the site seems to be coming together nicely now. There will be several tutorial tracks. Each in their own folder in content/tutorial/track.
Now we will create several new html templates to:
  - display all tutorial tracks, using a cool responsive [card]() design.
  - display a list of the contents of each single track.
  - display each tutorial

We will explore [pagination]() and since our directory structure is becoming rather deep, add [breadcrumbs]().

This will be a busy tutorial, so stay tuned!
