		<h1 id="building-websites-without-html">Building websites &lsquo;without html&rsquo;</h1>
<p>When you write more than a few pages of Html, you quickly get tired of the nonsense.
Which (among other reasons) is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> was build.</p>
<p>To convert a collection of markdown files into a functional website and do extra processing to build your website code, you can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system#Static_site_generators">site generator</a>.</p>
<p>The most famous of these (because it was the &lsquo;first&rsquo;) is <a href="http://jeyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.
I gave it a spin, but because Go is my new favourite programming language (comes with a nice <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/text/template">template library</a>), I started to look for something writtin in it.</p>
<h1 id="enter-hugo">Enter Hugo</h1>
<p><a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> then became the natural choice. It has many nice features, it&rsquo;s fast and it&rsquo;s written in Go! What more could I want?</p>
<p>So basically Hugo creates 2 views by default, one is a &lsquo;folder view&rsquo; (list) and the other is a singe page view.
They are created by the templates list.html and single.html, which are in turn created by the baseof.html template.
A list view will use markdown file &lsquo;content/foo/_index.md&rsquo;, a page view will use &lsquo;content/foo/bar.md&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Each theme will/should have a Readme on what kinds of content you should add.
You add new content with the command &lsquo;hugo new folder/file.md&rsquo;, this adds the basic preamble with settings that the system needs.
After that you can edit the file content/folder/file.md.</p>
<h2 id="difficult-to-get-started">Difficult to &lsquo;get started&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it is more complicated to get started. The <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">documentation</a> does a good job of explaining the basic functions, but finding a good introduction for beginners was difficult.</p>
<p>The only beginner tutorials I could find just say &ldquo;Install Hugo, select a theme and pump out Markdown files&rdquo;. Which is great! Because that means it&rsquo;s easy to make a nice site for just about anybody. However, how to learn Hugo well enough to work with it to produce a custom site?</p>
<p><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-quick-tutorial-on-hugo-templates-creating-your-theme-a4102b42a85f">Here</a>
is a very nice tutorial to get you started in writing your first templates. After this the <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">official documentation</a> should start to make sense! Enjoy!</p>
