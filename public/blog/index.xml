      <description>I thought all stylesheet examples looked convoluted and confusing (they are). So I decided to switch to using a CSS framework (bootstrap). However, I came across SASS and it just made CSS much easier to &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; the hierarchy. So I decided to not use bootstrap for this site, but learn CSS a little bit.
Set up SASS stylesheets with Hugo In partial/head.html, you will want something like this:
	&amp;lt;!-- Custom CSS --&amp;gt; {{ $custom := resources.</description>

      <description>Building websites &amp;lsquo;without html&amp;rsquo; When you write more than a few pages of Html, you quickly get tired of the nonsense. Which (among other reasons) is why Markdown was build.
To convert a collection of markdown files into a functional website and do extra processing to build your website code, you can use a site generator.
The most famous of these (because it was the &amp;lsquo;first&amp;rsquo;) is Jekyll. I gave it a spin, but because Go is my new favourite programming language (comes with a nice template library), I started to look for something writtin in it.</description>

      <description>First post! I thought it would be nice to chronicle my descent into madness here. I decided to learn to make websites, this here being the first.
Whenever I learn something new or interesting about development or the technologies I use, there will be a small post in my blog and/or on my wiki. Personally, I prefer a wiki, but then I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get to practice making this cool blagging site.</description>
