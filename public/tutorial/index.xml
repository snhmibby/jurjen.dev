      <description>Improving the default templates The idea for the site seems to be coming together nicely now. There will be several tutorial tracks. Each in their own folder in content/tutorial/track. Now we will create several new html templates to:
 display all tutorial tracks, using a cool responsive card design. display a list of the contents of each single track. display each tutorial  We will explore pagination and since our directory structure is becoming rather deep, add breadcrumbs.</description>

      <description>Back to learning CSS, SASS edition I thought all stylesheet examples looked convoluted and confusing (they are). So I decided to switch to using a CSS framework (Bootstrap, it&amp;rsquo;s quite nice). However, I came across SASS and it just made CSS much easier to use AND understand. Having a bit of structure makes all the difference for comprehension and readability.
So I decided to not use bootstrap for this site, but use SASS stylesheets instead.</description>

      <description>Building websites with Markdown instead of HTML When you write more than a few pages of HTML, you quickly get tired of the nonsense. Which (among other reasons) is why Markdown was build.
To convert a collection of markdown files into a functional website and do extra processing to build your website code, you can use a site generator.
The most famous of these (because it was the &amp;lsquo;first&amp;rsquo;) is Jekyll.</description>

      <description>First post! Whenever I learn something new or interesting about development or the technologies I use, there will be a small post in my blog and/or on my wiki. Personally, I prefer a wiki, but then I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get to practice making this cool blagging site.
Follow along on my journey! In short, every major update on this site since the beginning will get a blog post. If you want to follow along on my process on getting started from 0% with Hugo and website building in general, just follow the blogs from beginning to end.</description>
